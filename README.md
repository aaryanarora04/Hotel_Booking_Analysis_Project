# Hotel_Booking_Analysis_Project
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover valuable insights and trends. By utilizing Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we aim to enhance revenue generation efficiency for hotels and provide actionable business recommendations.

# Business Problem
In recent years, both City Hotels and Resort Hotels have experienced high cancellation rates. These cancellations lead to several challenges, including reduced revenue and underutilized hotel rooms. Our primary goal is to address this issue by lowering cancellation rates and offering comprehensive business advice to improve revenue efficiency. <br>

# Assumptions
-The information provided is current and can be used to analyze a hotel‚Äôs potential strategies effectively. <br>
-There are no unforeseen drawbacks to implementing any recommended techniques. <br>
-The hotels are not currently utilizing any of the suggested solutions. <br>

# Research Questions
-What variables influence hotel reservation cancellations? <br>
-How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations? <br>
-How can hotels make informed pricing and promotional decisions? <br>

# Hypotheses
-Higher prices lead to more cancellations. <br>
-Longer waiting lists result in increased cancellation rates. <br>
-Most clients make reservations through offline travel agents. <br>

# Key Insights
-Approximately 37% of clients canceled their reservations, significantly impacting hotel earnings. <br>
-City hotels have more bookings compared to resort hotels, possibly due to lower prices. <br>
-On certain days, the average daily rate for city hotels is less than that of resort hotels. <br>

# Conclusion
This project has been an exciting journey, and I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to apply my data analysis skills. If you have any questions or would like to explore the dataset further, feel free to connect with me! Let‚Äôs continue the conversation. ü§ùüìà
